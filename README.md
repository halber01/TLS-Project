Hello,

I am implementing a KEMTLS key exchange with a server for my project module in University. You can find the scheme under:
https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1019.pdf (Page: 6 Fig. 2)

I am using following repos for simplicity:
KEMTLS: https://github.com/GiacomoPope/kyber-py

Requirements:
Python 3.5 or higher

HOW TO USE:

Start Server:
cd kemTLS_halber
python3 server.py

Start Client:
cd kemTLS_halber
python3 client.py
